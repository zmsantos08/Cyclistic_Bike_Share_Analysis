# “The Sunday Explorer vs. The Monday Commuter”: Closing the Membership Gap

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone. The objective was to understand how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently. These insights serve as the foundation for a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into long-term annual members.

## Data
The analysis uses Divvy's (Chicago's public bike-share system) historical trip data between Jan-Nov of 2025, which is public data made available by Motivate International Inc, click [here](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) to view the agreement.

## Tools & Technologies
SQL (BigQuery): Used for large-scale data cleaning and transformation. Link [here](

R / Quarto: Used for EDA, visualizations and generating the final report.

## Key Findings
Temporal Patterns: Annual members show high activity during weekday "rush hours" (8 AM and 5 PM), suggesting a commuting pattern. Casual riders peak on weekends, indicating leisure use.

Ride Duration: Casual riders consistently take longer trips on average than annual members across all days of the week.

Seasonal Trends: Both groups show increased ridership in summer months, but casual rider volume drops more significantly during winter.

## Recommendations
Based on the data, the following strategies are proposed:

Weekend Membership Tier: Introduce a weekend-only or "Leisure Pass" to capture frequent casual riders who primarily use the service for recreation.

Seasonal Promotions: Launch targeted digital campaigns during late spring and summer when casual ridership is highest.

Commuter Benefits: Highlight the time-saving and cost-efficiency of annual memberships for weekday travel to target regular casual commuters.
