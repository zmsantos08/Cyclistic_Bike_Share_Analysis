# “The Sunday Explorer vs. The Monday Commuter”: Closing the Membership Gap

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone. The objective was to understand how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently. These insights serve as the foundation for a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into long-term annual members.

## Data
The analysis uses Divvy's (Chicago's public bike-share system) historical trip data between Jan-Nov of 2025, which is public data made available by Motivate International Inc, click [here](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) to view the agreement.

## Tools used
SQL (BigQuery): Used for large-scale data cleaning and transformation. Click [here](https://github.com/zmsantos08/Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/3750159ce86dd296b505e5bc9a447c0e7c81ad16/Cyclistic_SQLCode.sql) for the full SQL Script.

R / Quarto: Used for EDA, visualizations and generating the final report.

Google Slides: Used to create stakeholder's presentation [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zPJjSpF919dl1g38yZpMrmKigfDHsK0ZfWOnwxA1K8s/edit?usp=sharing)

## Key Findings
Temporal Patterns: Annual members show high activity during weekday "rush hours" (8 AM and 5 PM), suggesting a commuting pattern. Casual riders peak on weekends, indicating leisure use.

Ride Duration: Casual riders consistently take longer trips on average than annual members across all days of the week.

Seasonal Trends: Both groups show increased ridership in summer months, but casual rider volume drops more significantly during winter.

## Recommendations
Based on the data, the following campaigns are proposed:

**The “Casual” Mindset Shift:** 

The idea is to show the daily commuters of Chicago the benefits of using bikes for their daily mobility needs, such as:

* Faster: By being able to avoid peak-hour traffic congestion, making travel time more predictable
  
* Cheaper: By highlighting the no-maintenance, no gas and low cost transportation

* Lifestyle: By highlighting the low environmental carbon footprint, mental decompression and added exercise as a bonus, in an ever increasing sedentary and screen-centric world.
Seasonal Promotions: Launch targeted digital campaigns during late spring and summer when casual ridership is highest.

**The “Explorer” Pass**

A membership designed specifically around the needs and usage patterns of this segment. By engaging this audience over a five-month peak season (May-September), we can normalize recurring use, leverage valuable insights and build direct communication, creating a strong foundation to convert Summer season users (members) to an annual plan down the line.

Core Value Proposition:

Flexibility: No rigid peak-hour rules, extended ride times.
Longer trips: Longer ride windows before overage fees.
Leisure timing: Optimized for weekends & afternoons.
Summer-focused: Five-month peak season.
